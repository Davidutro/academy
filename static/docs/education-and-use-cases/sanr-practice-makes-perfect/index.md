## Trader DNA ðŸ§¬

As Maksim Balashevich, the mastermind behind Santiment, puts it, "SanR is not
widely known, but for me maybe the main reason to use SanR is to build up,
reflect and accept your 'trader DNA' and then build strategy without pushing
down/controlling your emotions." In other words, SanR is like a mirror that
reflects your trading style, helping you understand your emotional triggers and
make decisions based on insights rather than impulses.

But here's the best part â€“ you're not alone on this journey! SanR is like a
big, friendly community of traders, all learning and growing together. It's a
place where you can share your experiences, learn from others, and celebrate
your successes. As Maksim says, "With SanR it's now much easier as I do both
now-leave prediction (call) the moment it arrives, do 'trade' a bit later."

Think of SanR as your personal trading diary, where every prediction is like a
snapshot of your journey. As you look back on your trades, you'll start to see
patterns emerge â€“ maybe you have a knack for spotting trends, or perhaps you
tend to get a bit too excited when the market's on a roll. Whatever your
"trader DNA" may be,SanR helps you understand and embrace it.

last push is possible...seen and experienced this pain quite a few times. With
SanR it's now much easier."
