**Token Age Consumed** (TAC) is a reliable on-chain indicator that signals significant changes in market conditions. This metric assigns higher value to coins that have been held for a longer duration, compared to those recently acquired. 

Spikes in the Token Age Consumed (TAC) chart indicate the movement of tokens that have been dormant for a considerable period. The underlying assumption is that long-term holders and experienced traders usually make well-informed decisions based on thorough analysis and deep market understanding. Therefore, it can be **extremely beneficial** to monitor when these individuals begin to transfer their holdings. 

Such events can introduce volatility to the tokenâ€™s short-term price action. The direction of this volatility, whether upward or downward, is unique to each situation. However, a spike in TAC is always a prompt to pay closer attention. 

Consider Bitcoin's Token Age Consumed chart for the past six months. Almost every significant peak either signaled an impending correction (red), or occurred at the lowest point of the rally (green):

The same pattern can be observed with an altcoin. For instance, all recent spikes in Bancor's (BNT) Token Age Consumed either correlated with increasing downward pressure (red) or signaled a rebound (green):

For further illustration, here's Aragon's Token Age Consumed chart, which aligns closely with major changes in price action:

From a fundamental standpoint, spikes in Token Age Consumed are among the most reliable indicators of volatility in the crypto market. When a substantial amount of 'old money' starts to move, there's almost always a significant reason behind it. Being aware of these movements as they occur is crucial.
