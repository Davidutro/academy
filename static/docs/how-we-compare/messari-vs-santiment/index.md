In this article we’ll be comparing Sanbase and Messari, two popular market intelligence platforms for cryptocurrencies. 

While both platforms offer a number of additional benefits to their subscribers, we’ll be focusing our comparative analysis on four main features of both platforms: 

* Charts
* Screener
* Market insights
* Pricing

Let’s jump right in:

## Charts

Both Sanbase and Messari offer charting tools and indicators for hundreds of cryptocurrencies, derived from a variety of information sources and data points. 

In terms of general market overview, both platforms offer extensive financial information on digital assets including price, volume and market cap. 

On top of a coin’s total supply, Messari has also introduced so-called ‘reported supply’, which tracks the supply of a digital asset as ‘commonly reported in the industry’, as well as the coin’s ‘reported market cap’.

As for on-chain information, Sanbase does provide a more comprehensive overview of network activity and the behavior of different on-chain stakeholders. 

Both Sanbase and Messari offer information on entry-level metrics such as daily active addresses and on-chain transaction volume, with Messari covering around 50 assets and Sanbase covering ~1700 assets. On top of this, Sanbase also provides time-series data on 50 additional on-chain indicators for BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, LTC and more than 1300 ERC-20 coins. A full list can be seen below.

Outside of price and on-chain information, Sanbase also tracks social activity data of 1700+ cryptocurrencies, based on information from 1000+ crypto-related social media channels including Telegram groups, Discord servers, crypto subreddits, Twitter and professional trader chats. Using this dataset, Sanbase has introduced a number of social indicators including social volume, relative social dominance and crowd sentiment. 

Additionally, Sanbase also covers development activity information on 1700+ crypto projects,  by collecting development-related 'events' in the projects’ public Github repositories (not counted: comments on issues, forks, stars, etc.).

Finally, Sanbase also provides relevant data on Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives, currently providing information on Bitmex perpetual contracts including funding rate, open interest, open value and more. 

We’ll break down the metrics available on each platform below, including complementary features to both charting tools. Keep in mind that all comparisons are made at the time of writing (November 2020) - additional features may have been introduced to each platform in the meantime.

## Screener

Both Sanbase and Messari include a detailed cryptocurrency Screener, allowing users to filter digital assets based on multiple criteria and market parameters. 

Messari’s Screener supports ranking coins by the following metrics:

* On-chain transaction volume
* Real (and reported) volume 
* Amount staked

Additionally, Messari offers a selection of pre-made and community screeners, including but not limited to:

* Coins invested in by various funds including Polychain Capital, Three Arrows Capital, Coinbase Ventures
* Smart contract platforms
* DeFi-related coins
* DeFi projects with active liquidity mining programs
* Assets ranked based on their proximity to price ATH

Sanbase screener, on the other hand, allows users to filter coins based on dozens of financial, on-chain, social and development indicators, individually or combined. 

For example, users can choose to filter all assets with an average of 100+ daily active addresses (implying strong fundamentals) and an MVRV ratio below 1, indicating currently undervalued conditions. 

A list of available filters for the Sanbase Screener include:

* Price
* Market Cap
* Volume
* Market segments (DeFi, interoperability, governance and dozens more)
* Social volume
* Development activity
* Daily active addresses
* Network growth
* On-chain transaction volume
* On-chain transaction volume (in USD)
* Circulation 
* Circulation (180d)
* Dormant circulation (1y)
* Exchange inflow
* Exchange inlow (in USD)
* Exchange outflow
* Exchange outflow (in USD)
* Exchange balance
* Supply on exchanges
* MVRV (30d, 180d and 365d)
* Mean dollar invested age

Additionally, Sanbase Screener also allows users to filter coins based on token flows between key stakeholders, like DEX traders to DeFi, whales to centralized exchanges and many more.

All of the above indicators can be filtered by a number of criteria, including above X, below X, between two values and inside a certain value range, as well as by their percent (%) change.

Sanbase Screener also features toggleable infographics for your filtered assets, including the price bar chart, price treemap and social volume treemap.
